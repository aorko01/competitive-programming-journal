# 🧠 Competitive Programming Practice Log

Welcome to my journey of becoming better at **Competitive Programming (CP)** — one week, one problem, one algorithm at a time.

---

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

This repository contains:

- 📆 **Week-by-week practice logs**
- 🧮 **Solved problems** with explanations (where needed)
- 🧩 **Algorithm implementations**
- 📚 **Notes on concepts** I’ve learned or reviewed
- 🌟 A list of **recommended problems** by topic & difficulty

Whether you're new to CP or revisiting fundamentals — I hope this helps you navigate the chaos of problem solving with a bit more clarity.
