# Week 1 - Competitive Programming Journal

## Getting Back on Track

Previously, I solved some Codeforces problems and participated in a few contests without a clear plan. As a result, my performance dropped significantly.

Now, Iâ€™m starting over with a serious mindset. I already have a basic understanding of STL, which should help me as I resume my CP journey.

## This Weekâ€™s Focus

I'm solving B-level problems on Codeforces using the following sheet:

ðŸ”— [Problem Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gg2QxRIYmzjznPZGTcVUZ0hso3Ix_T9vw7CMSnVcGo0/edit?usp=sharing)

You can track which problems I've solved there.

## Notes

- No fixed topic this week â€” solving problems randomly from the sheet  
- Rebuilding speed and problem-solving mindset  
- Listing resources and deeper learnings as I move forward  

## Thoughts on Good Problems

I'll be using this section to highlight and reflect on problems that stood out â€” whether because of their elegance, a neat trick, or a good learning opportunity.

### ðŸŸ¢ [Bear and Finding Criminals (Codeforces 680B)](https://codeforces.com/contest/680/problem/B)

This is a simple and intuitive two-pointers problem that's great for beginners. It helps build logic for symmetric traversal and boundary checking. I recommend this as a warm-up for those getting back into CP or starting out with problem-solving strategies.

### ðŸŸ¢ [Petr and a Combination Lock (Codeforces 1097B)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1097/B)

This is a classic example of using **bitmasking** or **bitwise enumeration** to check all possible combinations. The core idea is to try every subset of directions by rotating left or right and checking if the total angle sums to a multiple of 360Â°. Itâ€™s a clever brute-force problem that teaches how bitwise operations can be useful when you need to explore all possible configurations efficiently.

### ðŸŸ¢ [Good Start (Codeforces 2113B)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2113/problem/B)

This was a good problem for practicing careful case analysis. It requires recognizing and handling all the necessary scenarios thoughtfully, which makes it a great problem for improving attention to detail and logical completeness.

ðŸ§  You can refer to this image along with the tutorial to better understand the structure of the problem and its cases.


> I'll continue adding good problems like this in the README to help others discover valuable practice problems.
