# Week 1 - Competitive Programming Journal

## Getting Back on Track

Previously, I solved some Codeforces problems and participated in a few contests without a clear plan. As a result, my performance dropped significantly.

Now, Iâ€™m starting over with a serious mindset. I already have a basic understanding of STL, which should help me as I resume my CP journey.

## This Weekâ€™s Focus

I'm solving B-level problems on Codeforces using the following sheet:

ðŸ”— [Problem Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gg2QxRIYmzjznPZGTcVUZ0hso3Ix_T9vw7CMSnVcGo0/edit?usp=sharing)

You can track which problems I've solved there.

## Notes

- No fixed topic this week â€” solving problems randomly from the sheet
- Rebuilding speed and problem-solving mindset
- Listing resources and deeper learnings as I move forward
