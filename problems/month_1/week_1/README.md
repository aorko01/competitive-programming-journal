# Week 1 - Competitive Programming Journal

## Getting Back on Track

Previously, I solved some Codeforces problems and participated in a few contests without a clear plan. As a result, my performance dropped significantly.

Now, Iâ€™m starting over with a serious mindset. I already have a basic understanding of STL, which should help me as I resume my CP journey.

## This Weekâ€™s Focus

I'm solving B-level problems on Codeforces using the following sheet:

ðŸ”— [Problem Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gg2QxRIYmzjznPZGTcVUZ0hso3Ix_T9vw7CMSnVcGo0/edit?usp=sharing)

You can track which problems I've solved there.

## Notes

- No fixed topic this week â€” solving problems randomly from the sheet  
- Rebuilding speed and problem-solving mindset  
- Listing resources and deeper learnings as I move forward  

## Thoughts on Good Problems

I'll be using this section to highlight and reflect on problems that stood out â€” whether because of their elegance, a neat trick, or a good learning opportunity.

### ðŸŸ¢ [Bear and Finding Criminals (Codeforces 680B)](https://codeforces.com/contest/680/problem/B)

This is a simple and intuitive two-pointers problem that's great for beginners. It helps build logic for symmetric traversal and boundary checking. I recommend this as a warm-up for those getting back into CP or starting out with problem-solving strategies.

> I'll continue adding good problems like this in the README to help others discover valuable practice problems.
